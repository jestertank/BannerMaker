# BannerMaker
Thank you for downloading and supporting my little project.

What this does :
 This program creats 2 banners. One to be displayed on large over head tv or monitor 
and the second banner is for display on desktop work stations.

To use the program:
Place the 2 button pages in the folder you want.
Then run the Banner Dashboard
Put in the info you desire then save to the same loaction as the 2 "button" pagers.
Then set up a link to the "button" pages and when the page refreshes it will 
refresh the banner so it will be real time.
